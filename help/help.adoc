== OpenStack plugin use cases

The most common use for the OpenStack plugin is to create a server, create {PRODUCT} resources assigned to it, use the resources to run some operations, and then delete the resource and the server.

To accomplish these tasks you must:

. <<setupconfig,Create a plugin configuration>>.
. Use the <<Deploy>> procedure to deploy an OpenStack server.
. Create and use resources for this deployment. For example, create a new Command procedure step to use a resource that you created by adding a resource from a resource pool using the ec-perl sleep command for 30 seconds.
. Delete the resources.
. Use the <<Cleanup>> procedure to delete the deployed OpenStack server instance that you created with the <<Deploy>> procedure.
. After the job runs, view the results in {PRODUCT}.
