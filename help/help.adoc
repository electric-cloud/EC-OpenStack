[[setupconfig]]
== Setting up the plugin configuration

Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply across some or all of the plugin procedures. They reduce repetition of common values, create predefined sets of parameters for end users, and store credentials securely. Each configuration has a unique name that is automatically entered in designated parameters in the procedures.

The *Identity Service URL* must have http or https followed by your server hostname or IP address.

=== Input

. Go to *Administration* > *Plugins* to open the Plugin Manager.
. Find the EC-OpenStack row.
. Click *Configure* to open the OpenStack Configurations page.
. Click *Create Configuration*.
. To create an OpenStack configuration, enter the following information and click *OK*.

Remember that you may need to create additional configurations later.

=== Output

The OpenStack Configurations page now shows the new configuration.

You can also manage your OpenStack configurations on this page. Click *Edit* to modify an existing configuration or *Delete* to remove an existing configuration.
