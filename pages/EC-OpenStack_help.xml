  <p>OpenStack is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing project by Rackspace Cloud and NASA. It is free open source software released under the terms of the Apache License.</p>

  <p>The mission of the OpenStack project is to enable any organization to create and offer cloud computing services running on standard hardware. The community's first official release, code-named Austin, was made available just 4 months later with plans to release regular updates of the software every few months.</p>

  <p>OpenStack integrates code from NASA's Nebula platform as well as Rackspace's Cloud Files platform.</p>

    <h2>Electric Commander Integration to OpenStack</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
the plugin omit?
-->

    <p>The plugin communicates with OpenStack through its
  application programming interface (API) which provides support
  for developers who are building interactive clients of OpenStack using a RESTful application development style.
  EC-OpenStack plugin allows users to build a cloud by launching images and assigning metadata to instances, providing a more generic
  interface for managing resources.</p>

  <p>The plugin interact with OpenStack through the Compute API and Image API using PERL to
  perform the following tasks:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create configuration to hold connection information.</li>
    <li>Perform actions on machines.</li>
    <li>Deploy and delete servers.</li>
    <li>Create and delete keypairs.</li>
    <li>Create and delete floating IPs.</li>
    <li>Create Electric Commander resources.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This plugin provides two primary actions: Deploy and
  Cleanup, which work as a pair within a job.</p>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against OpenStack IceHouse</p>

    <p>Electric Commander minimum version 3.6</p>

    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

    <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
    parameters are shown in <span class='required'>bold
    italics</span>.</p>

    <div id="CreateConfiguration"><a name='CreateConfiguration' id=
    "CreateConfiguration"></a>

    <h3>Plugin Configuration</h3>
    <!-- If the plugin has separate configurations then include this section,
otherwise omit this whole section. We don't need to have a configuration
section that just says "There is no configuration for this plugin."
-->

    <p>Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply across
    some or all of the plugin's procedures. They are intended to
    reduce repetition of common values, create predefined sets of
    parameters for end users, and to securely store credentials
    where needed. Each configuration is given a unique name that is
    entered in designated parameters on procedures that use
    them.<br />
    Plugin configurations are created by going to the Electric
    Commander "Administration" tab, then to the "Plugins" sub-tab.
    On the right side of the line for the specific plugin, there is
    a "Configure" link which will open the Configuration
    page.<br />
    "Service URL" must have http/https followed by your server hostname or ip
    address.</p>
    <!-- For all parameters, the parameter name should be *exactly* the same as it appears in the
    Parameter Panel, and the first sentence(s) of the description should be
    the same as the tooltip (if there is one). After that, the parameter
    description can go into greater detail about the parameter including
    valid value ranges and examples.

-->

    <h2>Use Case 1: Deploy, Consume &amp; Cleanup Job</h2>

    <p>Deploy and cleanup work as a pair within a job.</p>

    <p>The most common use for this plugin is to create a server,
    then create an ElectricCommander resources assigned to it, use the resource(s) to run some
    operations, and the delete the resource and the server. To
    accomplish these tasks you must:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create a Plugin Configuration.</li>

      <li>Deploy an OpenStack server.</li>

      <li>Create a Resource(s) for this deployment.</li>

      <li>Use the created resource(s).</li>

      <li>Delete the resource(s).</li>

      <li>Delete the deployed server.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Create a Plugin Configuration</h4>

    <p>Plugin configurations are created by going to the Electric
    Commander "Administration" tab, then to the "Plugins" sub-tab.
    On the right side of the line for the EC-OpenStack plugin,
    there is a "Configure" link which will open the Configuration
    page.<br />
    Create a new configuration by specifying the requested
    parameters:</p><img alt="" src=
    "../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/create_config.png" />

    <p>Once the configuration is created, you can see it listed in
    "OpenStack Configurations", and now you are able to
    deploy a new server.</p>

    <h4>Deploy</h4>

    <p>Create a new Deploy procedure, fill in the requested
    parameters with real values from your OpenStack
    server:</p><img alt="" src=
    "../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/deploy_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Consume</h4>

    <p>Create a new command step to use the created resource, in
    this example we will pick a resource from the pool and just add
    an ec-perl sleep to use it for 30 seconds</p><img alt="" src=
    "../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/consume_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Cleanup</h4>

    <p>Now the resource has been used and is ready to be cleaned
    up, create a Cleanup step, fill in the requested
    parameters:</p><img alt="" src=
    "../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/cleanup_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Results and outputs</h4>

    <p>Once the job finished, you can see properties stored in
    "Results Location".<br />
    <img alt="" src=
    "../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/job.png" /></p><img alt=""
    src=
    "../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/results.png" />

    <p>Deploy output:</p><img alt="" src=
    "../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/deploy_log.png" />

    <p>Cleanup output:</p><img alt="" src=
    "../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/cleanup_log.png" />
